## Motivation

Working in a big repository with multiple people, sometimes you might lose track 
of you required composer packages. You have so many packages you can't be sure if they are used
or not.

You can use `composer why package/A` but that only gives you information about why this package is installed
in dependency to another package.

What if you need to find out if the provided *namespaces* of the package are used in your code?

`composer unused` to the rescue!

## Installation

Run

```bash
$ composer global require icanhazstring/composer-unused
```

## Usage

Run

```bash
$ composer unused
```

## Exclude folders and packages
Sometimes you don't want to scan a certain dir or ignore a composer package while scanning.
For this you can provide the `--excludeDir|-xd` or the `--excludePackage|-xp` parameter.

```bash
$ composer unused --excludeDir=config --excludePackage=symfony/console
```

> Make sure the package is named exactly as in your `composer.json`

> You can provide multiple folders and package by repeating the argument. 

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter some errors, try running

```bash
$ composer unused -vvv
```

This will enable debug mode and create an error report beside your `composer.json`.

## Example (doctrine/orm)

```html
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant/doctrine/orm$ composer unused
