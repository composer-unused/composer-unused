    // PHP-Scoper's goal is to make sure that all code for a project lies in a distinct PHP namespace. However, you
    // may want to share a common API between the bundled code of your PHAR and the consumer code. For example if
    // you have a PHPUnit PHAR with isolated code, you still want the PHAR to be able to understand the
    // PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase class.
    //
    // A way to achieve this is by specifying a list of classes to not prefix with the following configuration key. Note
    // that this does not work with functions or constants neither with classes belonging to the global namespace.
